#Classic Car Data Collection

Between 2016 and 2020 I maintained multiple periodic data scraping scripts to collect price points for classic cars from various sources. This resulted in over two million data points.

Note the scripts in this git are no longer maintained and the sdk used to scrape eBay has been deprecated. See here: https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/finding/callref/findCompletedItems.html
